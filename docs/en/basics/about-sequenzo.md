> I am profoundly grateful for all the effort and dedication poured into Sequenzo by every one of my team members. Without your nurturing care, Sequenzo could never have grown into what it is today â€” becoming an integral part of my PhD journey and taking a humble step forward within the community of social sequence analysis as well as computational and quantitative social science. Many thanks for the great support from my mentor Tim Liao, and my PhD advisor Ridhi Kashyap.

> I'm endlessly grateful to my family. Your love and understanding since I was a small kid have been the foundation of my courage to push boundaries, discover new worlds, and take risks. Grandparents watching from the stars, please continue guiding me, and I will always walk forward with your love in my heart.

> Let's continue to walk this path together, for our story has only just begun.
